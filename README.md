# The-Gaming-Room
Journal 8-2 Portfolio
1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  Our client was "The Gaming Room" and they wanted us to create a game called "Draw it or Lose it" that worked with multiple platforms.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
  I believe that I was able to correctly figure out what operating system should be used for this type of project.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 
  I think using a design document was great in planning what needs to be done and deciding what we should use for our project.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think improving the storage managemnt is important as if we could improve that function then nothing but good comes from it. I would imrpove it by bringing new ideas   to the table and figuring out what is the best course of action.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
  We based our software around what the user needs since it is important for the user to be able to play the game while that means lower memory usage, better storage       management, or availibility with multiple platforms.

6.How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
  Following my design template was most important in making sure I was putting everything needed together and also I would definetly use a design template for my next     project.
